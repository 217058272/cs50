**How do you represent the (decimal) integer 50 in binary?**
32/100000 + 16/10000 + 2/10 = 50/110010 

**How many bits must be "flipped" (i.e., changed from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0) in order to capitalize a lowercase a thatâ€™s represented in ASCII?**
Just one. A/65 a/97 or A/1000001 a/1100001 

**How do you represent the (decimal) integer 50 in, oh, "hexadecimal," otherwise known as "base-16"? Know that decimal is considered "base-10" (since it employs 10 digits, 0 through 9), and binary is considered "base-2" (since it employs 2 digits, 0 and 1). Infer from those base systems how to represent base-16!**

Base-16 uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F thus 16 alphanumeric characters.

3x16^1 + 2x16^0 = 50

(32)<sub>16</sub> = (50)<sub>10</sub>
