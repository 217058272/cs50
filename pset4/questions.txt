0.  How many different colors does each format support?
    BMP - 16M
    GIF - 256
    JEPG - 16M
    PNG - 256T
1.  Which of the formats supports animation?  
    GIF
    
2.  What’s the difference between lossy and lossless compression?
    lossless - original and uncompressed are the same
    lossy - original and uncompressed are about the same
    
3.  Which of these formats is lossy-compressed?
    lossless - BMP, GIF, PNG
    lossy - JPEG
    
4.  What happens, technically speaking, when a file is deleted on a FAT file system?
    First, the system modifies the filename’s first
    character in the file’s directory entry to signal that the file
    has been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
    Second, the system moves all of the file’s FAT clusters
    to the hard drive’s list of free clusters. The actual file
    data is never touched
    
5.  What can someone like you do to ensure (with high probability) that files you delete cannot be recovered?
    Overwrite all addressable locations with a random character,
    overwrite against with the character’s complement,
    and then verify. 
    
6.  What’s stdint.h?
    Allow you to use uintN_t
    
7.  What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
    Size of datatypes vary between systems by using the likes of intN_t we remain consistent with the length
    of data across disparate computer systems.
    
8.  How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
    BYTE - 8 bits
    DWORD - 32 bits
    LONG - 32 bits
    WORD - 16 bits
    
9.  What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be?
    0x4d42
    
10. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
    biSize - Size of bitmap file header
    bfSize - Size of bitmap info
    
11. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
    If the height is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper left corner.
    
12. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
    biBitCount
    
13. Why might fopen return NULL in copy.c:37?
    Out of free memory
    
14. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
    We only want to read 1 data element of the specfied size.
    
15. What value does copy.c:70 assign padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
    3
    
16. What does fseek do?
    Jumps a certain number of bytes starting from specified file position 
    
17. What is SEEK_CUR?
    Current position of the file pointer.
